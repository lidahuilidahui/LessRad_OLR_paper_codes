## Requirements

The code is written in Python 3 and relies on the following primary libraries:

* xarray
* pandas
* numpy
* ultraplot
* matplotlib

A `requirements.txt` file is provided for easier installation of dependencies using pip. Just use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".

## Data

The input data for this script are NetCDF files containing monthly mean OLR for each product, resampled to a 1째x1째 grid for the period 2001-2023. The script expects these files to be located at specific paths as indicated in the notebook (e.g., `F:\Research\Data\other_OLR_products\`). Users will need to:

1.  Acquire the necessary OLR datasets (LessRad OLR, CERES SYN, ERA5, CLARA-A3, HIRS, CERES EBAF) for the 2001-2023 period.
2.  Pre-process them into monthly means on a 1째x1째 grid, stored as NetCDF files.
3.  Update the file paths in the Jupyter Notebook to point to their local data locations.
4.  A land-sea mask file (`land_sea_mask_1degree.nc`) is also required and its path needs to be updated.

The LessRad OLR dataset itself is available at: https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.301403

## Usage

1.  Ensure all required Python libraries are installed (see `requirements.txt`).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ``` 
2.  Update the file paths for all input NetCDF datasets and the land-sea mask within the `Fig5_Fig10to12_plot_codes.ipynb` notebook.
3.  Open and run the Jupyter Notebook. The figures will be generated and saved as TIFF files (e.g., `Fig5_Global_Comparison_...tif`).

## Figures Generated by this Notebook:

* **Figure 5 (in manuscript):** Global, land, and ocean mean bias and RMSE of five OLR products relative to CERES EBAF (2001-2023). (Corresponds to the first figure generated by the notebook).
* **Figure 10 (in manuscript):** Bias and RMSE of five OLR products relative to CERES EBAF over the four major desert regions (2001-2023). (Corresponds to the second figure generated).
* **Figure 11 (in manuscript):** Bias and RMSE of five OLR products relative to CERES EBAF over the four major deep convection regions (2001-2023). (Corresponds to the third figure generated).
* **Figure 12 (in manuscript):** Bias and RMSE of five OLR products relative to CERES EBAF over the three polar/Tibetan Plateau regions (2001-2023). (Corresponds to the fourth figure generated).
